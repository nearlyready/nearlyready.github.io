Allow me to make a bold general statement:

Playing the guitar is all about recognizing shapes and patterns.

OK, perhaps that’s a bit of an exaggeration, but there’s no doubt that the ability to recognize, use and generate shapes and patterns on the fretboard is of vital importance in learning to play this instrument.

What do I mean when I talk about “shapes and patterns”. Well, here are some examples of the kind of shapes and patterns that will be presented in these lessons (Note: You don’t have to learn these items yet!):

Intervals

Scales

Chords

It’s not hard to understand shapes and patterns like these are such an important part of playing guitar: This arises naturally from the fact that notes arranged on the neck in a two-dimensional grid. Contrast this with the “linear” layout of notes on many other instruments like the saxophone and piano.

By the way, as mentioned earlier this course is presented in terms of **fourths tuning**. The beauty of fourths tuning is that greatly reduces the number of shapes and patterns that you need to learn to a minimum. This is because unlike standard tuning, fourths tuning produces perfect symmetry on the guitar neck.

Now having stressed the great significance of shapes and patterns on the guitar, here’s the important point: **During our lessons I will make it clear what shapes and patterns matter the most**. ***Please learn them***. This will take some effort, but you won’t regret it.
