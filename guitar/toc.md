Playing the guitar – jazz guitar in particular – is another interest of mine that I’ll try to describe in this website. I am no expert, but by laying out some of my thoughts in a straightforward way, hopefully I can help others wanting to progress beyond a basic knowledge of the instrument to avoid some of the wrong turns that I have taken on my journey.

Now there’s something that I’d better mention at the outset: **The lessons on these pages are presented in terms of an uncommon (but increasingly popular) guitar tuning called fourths tuning**. After much deliberation, I switched over to fourths tuning many years ago, because it is (in my opinion) more logical than standard tuning, while not being that different. And (again, in my opinion) this consistency greatly simplifies the task of learning to play guitar. These are bold claims. I hope to provide more justification for them as we progress.
